### County-Level PV System Data

This dataset provides aggregated statistics for photovoltaic (PV) systems at the county level. The data includes information such as the total number of PV systems, total PV area, median and average PV area, and the percentage of systems by type (e.g., residential, commercial) for each county.
**County-Level Aggregation**:
   - county FIPS code.
   - Aggregated the data at the county level to calculate:
     - Total number of PV systems (`Total PV system count`).
     - Total PV area (`Total PV area (m^2)`).
     - Median PV area (`Median PV area (m^2)`).
     - Average PV area (`Average PV area (m^2)`).
   - Percentage of System Types:
    - Calculated the percentage of each system type (e.g., residential, commercial) within each county.
        - Percentage of residential systems (`pct residential systems (%)`).
        - Percentage of commercial systems (`pct commercial systems (%)`).
        - Percentage of utility scale systems (`pct utility scale systems (%)`).
        - Percentage of solar heat systems (`pct solar heating systems (%)`).
