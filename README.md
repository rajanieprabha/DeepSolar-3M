## Overview

DeepSolar-3M provides fast, high-resolution mapping of rooftop photovoltaic (PV) systems across the United States.  
This repository contains county-level and blockgroup-level aggregated data from our AI pipeline.

**Key features:**
- Scalable detection of PV installations from aerial imagery 
- Blockgroup-level and county-level aggregation of PV system statistics
- Detailed breakdowns by system type (residential, commercial, utility-scale, solar heating)

---

## 📊 County-Level Dataset

Each entry corresponds to a U.S. county (identified by FIPS code) and includes:

- **Total PV system count**  
- **Total PV area** (in square meters)  
- **Median PV area** (m²)  
- **Average PV area** (m²)

**Breakdown by system type (% of systems):**
- Residential systems
- Commercial systems
- Utility-scale systems
- Solar heating systems
